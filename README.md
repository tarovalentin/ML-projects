# ML-projects
Repos for all ML projects
# This first project trains a neural network to predict apple stock returns using the following features: past time series,
# the federal interest rate, inflation, GDP growth, housing sales, and consumer confidence index. We predict returns rather than
# future stock price, since the stock price needs the scalrnig to be updated at each time step, while the return usually is in
# a limited range and so only has to be scaled once. Python 3.7.4 is used.
